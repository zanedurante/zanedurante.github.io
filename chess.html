                <p style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50em">What is this website?  What are you doing here??  Well, I can only answer the first question. Here, I plan to post all sorts of unique chess content!  In particular, I have been following the habits series 
                    by Chessbrah, and I think this is one of the most fun and educational chess series I've ever seen.  So, I plan to put puzzles/lessons on this website that can help reinforce
                the lessons I've learned so far.  This is mainly intended for personal use, but I hope others (like you) will find this equally helpful.</p>
